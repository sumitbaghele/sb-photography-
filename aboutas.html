        <h1>01. Remember that less is more</h1>
As one of the most important parts of your portfolio, it is imperative that your photographer 'About Me' page appears on your website menu. This practice is a must regardless of whether your bio has a dedicated page or appears as a strip on your one-page website. In any case, your visitors shouldn’t have to click more than once before finding it
Simplicity is the key word here, also when it comes to naming your page. The best practice is to go for 'About' or ‘Bio,’ which are the most widespread, and thus the most identifiable. Names like ‘Skills’ or ‘Info’ could be confused with your ‘Services’ page or your ‘Contact’ form, so it’s best to avoid them.
When arriving on your page, visitors should face a clear and informative headline. A single-line phrase like “Meet Henri Quart-Tiers” is perfect for telling your visitors what they should expect to find on the page. You can also go for something along the lines of “Zoom in on Henri Quart-Tiers,” if you want to take the photo metaphor to the next level. In any case, make sure that the tone of this headline and of the first sentences is welcoming and conversational, since you want to intrigue your readers and make them eager to get to know you better.
Pro photographer bio example: Take a look at the quote below to see how Robert Stephens managed to summarize the essence of his work in just a few words.
“Photography is my passion - nature is my refuge. Combine the two, and that is where I am most at peace.”
Pro 'About Me' photographer example: You can also follow Martin Olson’s steps and take a minimalist approach on your entire bio page.
